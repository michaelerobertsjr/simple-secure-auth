# About Guide
This tutorial will guide intermediate developers though the stages needed to engineer a user
authentication and management system or more commonly referred to as a Customer Relationship 
Management (CRM) system using Node.js and MongoDB.  Through the first stage learn how to 
generate and form a projects base and structure for testing, readability and maintainability 
with the Express4 framework.  Once a project base template is establish  developers will 
create HTTPS connection for their application during development, testing and implementation 
cycles.  After this a lesson on how to use jade effectively will be made with a emphasis on 
applying the Bootstrap library for creating smart interfaces.  Lastly with the use a Node.js 
package called Mongoose developers will apply Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) 
principles to the database management system with for the application user database. When all 
the steps needed to engineer a secure user authentication and management system developers 
will have a base template model to integrate or build on for future projects.
